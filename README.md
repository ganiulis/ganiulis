Hello. I'm Gintaras.

I keep my stuff here:

1. [Dotfiles](https://github.com/ganiulis/dotfiles-0c49)
2. [Professional wiki (WIP)](https://github.com/ganiulis/ganiulis/wiki)
3. [Personal notes](https://ganiulis.github.io/notes-personal)
4. [Personal website (WIP)](https://ganiulis.github.io)

Current hyperfixations:

1. [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com), you know what it is
2. Bash scripts, because I got lazy writing commands
3. [mise-en-place](https://mise.jdx.dev), rootless development environment manager
4. [Neovim](https://neovim.io), the only text editor you'll ever need

Past hyperfixations:

1. [Fish](https://fishshell.com), the friendliest shell
2. [Starship](https://starship.rs), a fancy shell-agnostic prompt written in Rust
3. [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net), network-level ad blocker
